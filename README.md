# Filter_Testbench
MATALB + VHDL testbench for signal processing systems

File Setup:
1. Add teh .m file to MATALB
2. Add the .vhd file to Vivado, Quartus, etc/
3. Make the Testbench.vhd the top simulation file.
4. In the testbanch generics- edit the text file paths.

How to run the script:
1. In MATLAB - run all
2. When a pop-up window appears go to the HDL simulator and run the simulation.
3. Once the simulation is complete go back to MATLAB and click "OK" on the pop-up box - the test will continue

Note:
MATALB creates the input text file, the vhdl test bench creaates the output text file!

Once you get the script/sim running, you're more than welcome to modify the code so it suits your application :)
